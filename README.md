# This page is a directory for some of the coolest website/tools I found. All focused on exploring.

-[Railroad Map](https://openrailwaymap.org/): Useful to acess map of almost all used railways around the globe. (Site can be a bit slow)

[-Google earth](https://earth.google.com/web/@59.23243203,-118.63634219,747.39594652a,1252734.83597472d,35y,15.61736416h,11.48405004t,-0r/data=OgMKATA): I prefer google earth rather than to maps beecause of the 3d functionality. It lets you see most big citys in impressive detail and other places (such as mountain ranges) in not as good detail. 

-[Urban exploration Ressource](https://www.uer.ca/): A basic account of this site shows some urbex locations and lets you talk with other users. (Keep in mind that the this website doesn't give away spot locations and is rather mostly just a forum to communicate with other enthusiastes).

-[Trailforks](https://www.trailforks.com/trails/) : Trailforks is a database of all trails, wether hiking, mountain biking or any other recreational activity. Trailforks shows information (trail conditions) about specific trails as well as heatmaps to plan and organize your hike. 

[Stellarium](https://stellarium-web.org/) : Stellarium is a open source planetarium on your computer. It has extensive catalogues with hundreds of millions of stars and deep sky object. 

[ClearDarkSKy](https://www.cleardarksky.com/) : ClearDarkSky.com is a cloud forecasting website. It accuratly predicts the cloud coverage of your area. I like to use it to see how dark the night sky will be for stargazing/astrophotagraphy

[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/): Open street map is a more accurate google maps. It let's users contribute to locations by adding/changing details to make the map more precise. I personally enjoy looking at the transport map, it's really interesting.
