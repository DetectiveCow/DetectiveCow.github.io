#Website list

-[Railroad Map](https://openrailwaymap.org/): Useful to acess map of almost all used railways around the globe. (Site can be a bit slow)

[-Google earth](https://earth.google.com/web/@59.23243203,-118.63634219,747.39594652a,1252734.83597472d,35y,15.61736416h,11.48405004t,-0r/data=OgMKATA): I prefer google earth rather than to maps beecause of the 3d functionality. It lets you see most big citys in impressive detail and other places (such as mountain ranges) in not as good detail. 

-[Urban exploration Ressource](https://www.uer.ca/): A basic account of this site shows some urbex locations and lets you talk with other users. (Keep in mind that the this website doesn't give away spot locations and is rather mostly just a forum to communicate with other enthusiastes).

-[Trailforks](https://www.trailforks.com/trails/) : Trailforks is a database of all trails, wether hiking, mountain biking or any other recreational activity. Trailforks shows information (trail conditions) about specific trails as well as heatmaps to plan and organize your hike. 

[Stellarium](https://stellarium-web.org/) : Stellarium is a open source planetarium on your computer. It has extensive catalogues with hundreds of millions of stars and deep sky object. 

[ClearDarkSKy](https://www.cleardarksky.com/) : ClearDarkSky.com is a cloud forecasting website. It accuratly predicts the cloud coverage of your area. I like to use it to see how dark the night sky will be for stargazing/astrophotagraphy

[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/): Open street map is a more accurate google maps. It let's users contribute to locations by adding/changing details to make the map more precise. I personally enjoy looking at the transport map, it's really interesting.

 Artillery platforms along the coquihalla highway that would let hgihway patrol to shoot down the snow before it piled up and became a avalanche risk. prolly not in use now

# #Places I'd like to go in Canada
[Mount King george](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mount+King+George/@48.0578807,-139.7264798,5z/data=!4m11!1m3!11m2!2sBVJXwAraR4jtRVQhQPDRHO5OP1pf4g!3e2!3m6!1s0x537087a5491fbe89:0xa5512cda70a1ea36!8m2!3d50.5963888!4d-115.405!15sCgEqkgEEcGVha-ABAA!16s%2Fg%2F11clg_50xf?entry=ttu), mount king george seems like a nice mountain to try and peak, bc has a bunch of mountains to climnb but this is one id like to try. 

[Mount Pilchuck](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mt+Pilchuck/@48.0578807,-139.7264798,5z/data=!4m11!1m3!11m2!2sBVJXwAraR4jtRVQhQPDRHO5OP1pf4g!3e2!3m6!1s0x549ab43233fd5bad:0xf0dcde198862fd33!8m2!3d48.0578807!4d-121.7967923!15sCgEqWgMiASqSAQRwZWFr4AEA!16zL20vMGc2bjFt?entry=ttu), This mountain is nice because its pretty close and accesible to my house. You can acess it by paved roads and the mountain has multiple trails. What really stands out is the old lookout tower on top of the mountain with paranomic views on rainier mountains. Its probably really busy though because social media has made this spot famous. 

[Killarney Provincial Park](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Killarney+Provincial+Park/@52.3792586,-130.6518843,5z/data=!4m11!1m3!11m2!2sBVJXwAraR4jtRVQhQPDRHO5OP1pf4g!3e2!3m6!1s0x4d2e6c5ae9793ae1:0xab0f543d9d07100e!8m2!3d46.0130463!4d-81.4017487!15sCgEqWgMiASqSAQRwYXJr4AEA!16zL20vMDkyNjN4?entry=ttu), Killarney Provincial Park is a park I discovered while watching Xander Butnick on youtube. He went canoeing across the lakes in this park. It standsa out to me because I never really thought that ontario would have theses types of landscapes. I kinda thought it was all flat and borring. 

[Wells Gray Prov Park](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Wells+Gray+Provincial+Park/@52.3792586,-130.6518843,5z/data=!4m11!1m3!11m2!2sBVJXwAraR4jtRVQhQPDRHO5OP1pf4g!3e2!3m6!1s0x5381dbc505522a19:0x9d5c0a9146193d59!8m2!3d52.3792586!4d-120.1050093!15sCgEqWgMiASqSAQRwYXJr4AEA!16zL20vMDhiYnlm?entry=ttu) : This park is just a cool provincial park in bc, It has some great views and a few different waterfalls. Id definitively like to try and check it out someday. 



# #Forestry
I'd like to do forestry maybe so heres tools and website Im going to use.

Job boards
[Forestry Jobs In canada](https://www.canadian-forests.com/job.html). Basically a job board to find forestry opportunities all across Canada. (Even though I'd prefer bc)

[Forestry Jobs In The US](https://www.forestryusa.com/jobs.html). Same thing but in the united states. Not planning on working there though. 



Subreddits
[r/Forestry](https://www.reddit.com/r/forestry/). A place to discuss forestry with others online. Some are like me and others have jobs in the trade. 

[r/Tree Planting](https://www.reddit.com/r/treeplanting/). Subreddit for the discussion of treeplanting, cool place to hear other peoples experience. I think treeplanting is really good and challenging experience that will let you learn alot. 



Youtube videos
[Kat evergreen](https://www.youtube.com/@kat_evergreen). This person basically just documented her season of treeplanting and shows you what to expect. 

[BC Bigfoot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3GpMpfjHZk&ab_channel=BritishColumbiaBigfoot). This guy has a good video I'll link about being a forest technician, he has his own company i think and makes it look fun. But he doesnt really explain what he does or what a forest technician is.

[Hengda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3GpMpfjHZk&ab_channel=BritishColumbiaBigfoot). This guy has a video on what you do as a forestry technician in BC. He talks about what you do and what to expect i think. 

also i need to add like tree guide website and shit
