# This page is a directory for some of my favourite/most useful tools. Exploration focused. 

-[[Railroad Map]](https://openrailwaymap.org/): Useful to acess map of almost all used railways around the globe. (Site can be a bit slow)

[-Google earth](https://earth.google.com/web/@59.23243203,-118.63634219,747.39594652a,1252734.83597472d,35y,15.61736416h,11.48405004t,-0r/data=OgMKATA): I prefer google earth rather than to maps beecause of the 3d functionality. It lets you see most big citys in impressive detail and other places (such as mountain ranges) in not as good detail. 

-[Urban exploration Ressource](https://www.uer.ca/): A basic account of this site shows some urbex locations and lets you talk with other users. (Keep in mind that the this website doesn't give away spot locations and is rather mostly just a forum to communicate with other enthusiastes).

-Trailforks.com : Trailforks is a database of all trails, wether hiking, mountain biking or any other recreational activity. Trailforks shows information (trail conditions) about specific trails as well as heatmaps to plan and organize your hike.
